# CV-project 
ill use the article Biomedical Images Stitching Using ORB Feature Based Approach (2018) by Win and Kitjaidure as baseline for our project. In this article an improved ORB feature based approach is proposed as feature detection for image stitching. This is useful for some types of medical operations including long bones or the spine, where a whole image of the bones is needed. There are many different approaches for feature detection, which all includes advantages and disadvantages. ORB has a lower processing time compared to SIFT and Harris corners. Though, it is not scale invariant and more sensitive to noise which usually is an advantage.

# Git-Tutorial

- Der oprettes et repository på github

- Alle kloner sig ind i det med
        ```git clone <link>```


**Når vi så skal lave ændringer så skal man gøre følgende:**

```git pull```

så er man up to date


```(skrive/ændre kode)```

indtil man er færdig


```git add .```

så tilføjer man sine ændringer


```git commit -am "<besked>"```

så registrerer man ændringerne 


```git push```

så kommer de op i skyen
